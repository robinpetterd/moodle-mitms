<p align="center"><b>Border Lines</b></p>
<p> Since images can substantially increase the size of the pdf file, you may choose to print a border of lines instead of using a border image (be sure the Border Image option is set to No). </p>
<p> The Border Lines option will print a nice border of three lines of varying widths in the chosen color.</p>
