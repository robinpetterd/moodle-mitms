<h1>Notify third-party about wait-listed sessions</h1>

<p>If you want the third-party to be emailed when a user signs up for a
  wait-listed session, enable this option.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the third-party will only be notified when a user signs up (or
  cancels) for a scheduled session.</p>

<p>This is useful in the case where an external trainer wants to wait until
  there is a certain number of interested users before offering a
  session.</p>
