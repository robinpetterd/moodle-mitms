<h1>Face-to-face Activity</h1>

<p>Face-to-face activities are used to keep track of in-person trainings
  which require advance booking.</p>

<p>Each activity is offered in one or more identical sessions.  These
  sessions can be given over multiple days.</p>

<p>Reminder messages are sent to users and their managers a few days before
  the session is scheduled to start.  Confirmation messages are sent when
  users sign-up for a session or cancel.</p>
