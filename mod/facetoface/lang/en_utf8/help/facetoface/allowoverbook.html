<h1>Allow overbooking</h1>

<p>When "Allow overbooking" is checked, learners will be able to sign up for a face-to-face session even if it is already full.</p>

<p>When a learner signs up for a session that is already full, they will receive an email advising that they have been waitlisted for the session and will be notified when a booking becomes available.</p>
