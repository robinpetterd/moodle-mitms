<h1>Progress tick box</h1>

<p>
Tick boxes are displayed alongside some activities. These are
a way for you to track your progress through a course.
</p>

<p>
When you see a box with a dotted tick mark, you can click it to tick the
box. (You can click it again to remove the tick if you change your mind.)
</p>

<p>
These icons are for you to keep track of your own progress, and are entirely 
optional. If you like, tick the box when you think you've finished something.
</p>

<p>
Some courses may include blank tick boxes - empty spaces which do not have a 
dotted tick mark. You can't tick these boxes yourself, but they will be ticked 
automatically according to conditions that were set up when creating the course 
website. For example, a resource might automatically be ticked after you have 
downloaded the file. (You sometimes need to reload the course page to see this 
type of change.)
</p>

<p>
Some staff, such as your teacher, may have access to see which 
boxes you've ticked. However the information is not used in assessment and
does not count toward your course mark. You don't need to tick boxes if you
don't want to.
