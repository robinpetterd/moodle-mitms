<h1>Competency</h1>
<p>The competency to be assigned to the user. If you are editing an existing item of competency evidence, this cannot be changed.
You can however create a new item of competency evidence (if you have permission to do so) by visiting the user's My Records page
and clicking the 'Add competencyevidence' button.</p>
<p>
When creating a new competency evidence item you can choose between adding evidence for an existing competency or creating a new
competency. If you choose 'Select a competency' a popup will allow you to pick from the existing competencies. If you choose
'Create a new competency' a form will appear where you can choose a framework and define the new competency.
</p>
<p>
Note that you cannot create two competency evidence items that refer to the same user and competency. If you try to do this you
will be provided with a link to edit the original record or choose a different competency.
