<h1>Forum completion</h1>

<p>
The forum provides three special options which you can require in order that
it counts as completed.
</p>

<ul>
<li>User must post discussions or replies: the student must post a certain 
number of times to the forum, and it doesn't matter whether those posts are
new discussions or replies to existing discussions.</li>
<li>User must create discussions: the student must post a certain number of
new discussions.</li>
<li>User must post replies: the student must post a certain number of replies
in existing discussions.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can tick more than one option if necessary; this means both conditions
must be met before the forum counts as completed. For example, if you 
require 2 discussions and 10 'discussions or replies', then any combination
of 10 discussions/replies will be sufficient provided that it includes at least
2 discussions. (10 new discussions; 2 new discussions and 8 replies; or 
somewhere in between.)
