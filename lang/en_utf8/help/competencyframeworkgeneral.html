<h1>Competency Framework</h1>
<p>A competency framework is set up to hold a range of skills, knowledge and behavioural competencies.</p>

<p>Multiple competency frameworks can be set up; each one allowing competencies to be grouped, e.g. set up one framework for industry national competency standards and a different framework for specific in-house competencies.</p>
