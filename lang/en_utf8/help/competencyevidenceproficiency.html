<h1>Proficiency</h1>
<p>
This field records whether or not the user is deemed to be proficient at the assigned competency. The options that appear in the pulldown depend on the competency scale assigned to the chosen competency, so the competency must be selected before this field can be modified. A proficiency must be set to add or update a competency evidence record.
