<h1>Report Builder: Show by date</h1>

<p>This criteria is enabled by selecting the 'Show records based on the record date' checkbox. If selected, then the report will show different records depending on the date of the records and the date at the time it is viewed.</p>
<p>The 'Include records from' setting determines which records the user sees:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Set to 'The past':<br />The report only shows records with a date older than the current time (past records). This is updated every time the report is viewed.</li>
    <li>Set to 'The future':<br />The report only shows records with a date newer than the current time (future records). This is updated every time the report is viewed.</li>
    <li>Set to 'The last 30 days':<br />The report only shows records with a date in the last 30 days, i.e. between the current time and 30 days before.</li>
    <li>Set to 'The next 30 days':<br />The report only shows records with a date in the next 30 days, i.e. between the current time and 30 days into the future.</li>
</ul>
