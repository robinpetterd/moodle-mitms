<h1>Parent Organisation</h1>

<p>
When there are no further depth levels set up under an organisational framework then the first part of the organisation set up will appear as the 'parent' (at the top). All other parts of the organisation will appear under this parent organisational item.
</p>
<p>
When depth levels have been setup under an organisation framework the parent organisation field may be selected or any other depth level as the parent of the new item..
</p>
<p>
Setting up items at various levels helps to create the hierarchical relationship.
