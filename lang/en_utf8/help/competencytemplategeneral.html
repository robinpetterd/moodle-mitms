<h1>Competency Template</h1>
<p>A competency template is a way of grouping competencies from one competency framework together.</p>

<p>When setting up a training event, for example an induction course, this could be related to a competency template called ‘new employee competencies’; drawing automatically on a number of competencies, instead of repeatedly selecting the competencies one by one from scratch.</p>
