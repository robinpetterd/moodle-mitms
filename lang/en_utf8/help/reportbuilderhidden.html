<h1>Report Builder: Hide in Report Manager</h1>

<p>If this checkbox is checked, the report will not be shown in the Report Manager block for any users. This can be useful if you want to link to a report from a different location.</p>
<p>Note that the report is still available to any users with permissions to view it at the same URL, only the link is hidden.</p>
<p>If you are expecting your report to appear in the Report Manager block and it is not appearing, even with this box unchecked, the most likely cause is a problem with the access restrictions set on the report.</p>

<?php
