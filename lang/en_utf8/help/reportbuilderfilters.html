<h1>Report Builder: Filters</h1>

<p>The settings on this page determine which filters appear in this report. The available filter options are determined by the source of the report. When you create a new report it will typically create a default set of filters for you to modify as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Creating filters</strong><br />Choose a filter from the 'Add another filter...' pulldown. If you check the 'Advanced' checkbox, the filter will not appear on the report page until you click the 'Show advanced' button. This lets you provide lots of search options without having to show them all on every page. Click save changes. The new filter will be added to the end of the list. Repeat to create multiple new filters.</p>
<p><strong>Moving filters</strong><br />Click the up or down arrows to the right of the report filter to swap two filters. The order that filters appear will match this page, with filters highest in the list appearing first in the report.</p>
<p><strong>Deleting filters</strong><br />Click the cross to the right of the report filter to remove that filter from the report.</p>
<p><strong>Altering filters</strong><br />You can change the advanced option by clicking on the checkboxes then clicking 'Save changes'. You can also modify multiple filter types at the same time by adjusting the pulldown menu values then clicking 'Save changes'.</p>
