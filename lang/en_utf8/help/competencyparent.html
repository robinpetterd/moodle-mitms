<h1>Parent Competency</h1>
<p>The first time a competency is set up in a competency framework this will be at the highest level (parent). Further depth levels of competency may be set up, and the ‘parent’ competencies will sit above these (at the top level).</p>
<p>Each time a new depth level is set up the higher level competencies will appear in a drop down list so that these can be chosen as the parent of the new competency.</p>
<p>A new competency can be set up at any level within the framework.</p>
