<h1>Report Builder: Source</h1>

<p>The source of a report determines what records the report shows, and also decides what columns you can choose to show, and what search filter options are available. You can pick from the available sources in the pulldown menu.</p>
<p>If no sources are available, or the one you want does not appear you will need your moodle installation to be configured to include the source you need (it cannot be done via the moodle interface).</p>
<p>Once a source has been selected, it cannot be changed for that report. If you want to change the source you should create a new report based on the new source and delete the old report.</p>
