<h1>Competency Scales</h1>
<p>Competency scales enable you to define the criteria by which a competency can be measured. For example, a scale might have three values ‘competent, competent with supervision, not competent’.</p>

</p>The first step is to use the Competency scales option to add a new scale, then to add the scale values which are used to define a learner’s progress for a competency. You can add as many values as you wish. Note also the Default and Proficient value settings.</p>
