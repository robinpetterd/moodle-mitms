<h1>Report Builder: Columns</h1>

<p>The settings on this page determine which columns appear in this report. The available column options are determined by the source of the report. When you create a new report it will typically create a default set of columns for you to modify as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Creating columns</strong><br />Choose a column from the 'Add another column...' pulldown. In the text field type in a name for the column. This will appear in the report above that column. Click save changes. The new column will be added to the end of the list. Repeat to create multiple new columns. Note that you can only create one column of each type within a single report. You will receive a validation error if you try to include the same column more than once.
<p><strong>Moving columns</strong><br />Click the up or down arrows to the right of the report column to swap two columns. The order that columns appear will match this page, with columns highest in the list appearing to the left of the report.</p>
<p><strong>Deleting columns</strong><br />Click the cross to the right of the report column to remove that column from the report.</p>
<p><strong>Altering columns</strong><br />You can rename a column by changing the Heading text and clicking 'Save changes'. You can also modify multiple column types at the same time by adjusting the pulldown menu values then clicking 'Save changes'.</p>
